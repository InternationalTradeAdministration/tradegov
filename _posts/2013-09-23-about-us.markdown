<h3>About Us</h3>
<p style="float: left; margin: 0 0.833em 0.208em 0;"><img src="https://new.export.gov/system/cms/files/10/files/original/city-moutains-coastline.jpg" alt="africa coastline" width="250" height="150" /></p>

<p>Sub-Saharan Africa presents enormous opportunities to the American private sector. According to the World Bank, its gross domestic product (GDP) totaled approximately $1.25 trillion in 2011, and six of the 10 fastest-growing economies in the world are in sub-Saharan Africa. U.S. total merchandise exports to sub-Saharan Africa tripled between 2001 and 2011.</p>

<p>Economic growth is good news for American businesses and our friends in Africa. The growing African market is increasingly attractive to "Made in America" products and the "Doing Business in Africa" (DBIA) program is working to make it easier for U.S. firms to operate in this dynamic market.</p>

<p>To achieve this goal, a whole-government approach will:</p>

<ul>

<li>* Promote more U.S. trade with Africa</li>

<li>* Increase trade financing</li>

<li>* Engage with important stakeholders &ndash; like the United States&rsquo; African Diaspora community &ndash; to ensure they have all the tools needed to do business in the African market.</li>

</ul>

<p>To achieve these goals, DBIA is involved in a several initiatives:</p>

<ul>

<li>* Organizing an Africa Global Business Summit Series so that U.S. companies can hear directly from our Ambassadors in Africa and Senior Commercial Officers about opportunities in the region</li>

<li>* Opening the U.S.-Africa Clean Energy Development and Finance Center in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2013 to help identify and access U.S. government support for clean energy export and investment needs</li>

<li>* Developing an Africa Business Portal, providing valuable information about trade assistance programs and financing.</li>

</ul>

<p>This campaign will leverage the resources from across the federal government's trade promotion, financing and strategic communications capabilities to help U.S. businesses identify and seize opportunities in Africa, and to help them overcome any challenges they face to establishing business relationships with Africa.</p>
